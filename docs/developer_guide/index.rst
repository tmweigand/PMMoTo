Developer Guide
====================

This section is intended for developers and contributors who want to work on PMMoTo itself.
It covers setting up a development environment, running tests and benchmarks, contributing
code, and preparing releases. These pages assume some familiarity with Python development
tools and are not required for typical users of the library.
